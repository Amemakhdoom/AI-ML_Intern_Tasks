# AI/ML Internship Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset

## Task Objective
Learn how to load, inspect, and visualize a dataset to understand data trends, distributions, and patterns.

## Dataset Used
Iris Dataset (CSV format, can be loaded via seaborn or downloaded)

## Instructions Followed
- Loaded the dataset using **pandas**
- Printed the **shape**, column names, and the first few rows using `.head()`
- Used `.info()` and `.describe()` to generate summary statistics
- Visualized the dataset using **matplotlib** and **seaborn**:
  - Scatter plots to show relationships between features
  - Histograms to show value distributions
  - Box plots to identify outliers

## Models Applied
No predictive model applied in this task; focus was on **data exploration and visualization**.

## Key Results and Findings
- Successfully loaded and explored the Iris dataset
- Identified relationships between features (e.g., sepal length vs petal length)
- Detected distribution patterns and potential outliers using histograms and box plots
- Developed foundational skills in data inspection, descriptive statistics, and visualization with pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn

## Skills Practiced
- Data loading and inspection with pandas
- Descriptive statistics and data exploration
- Basic plotting and visualization using matplotlib and seaborn
